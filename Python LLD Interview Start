📌 One practical trick for interviews

Python does not have true access modifiers — it relies on naming conventions and developer discipline.

When you start coding in Python for LLD, say:
“I’ll implement this in Python for brevity, but I’ll follow strong OOP principles as if we were writing this in a typed language like Java.”
This immediately sets the interviewer’s expectations.
